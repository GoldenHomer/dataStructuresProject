how would I walk back parent pointers to root?
walk path from n to root? probably same as above

10/25/16: is LOCAL name actually the contents of the node(directory)? yes

follow does what again? wrote on paper
assume the path in follow is which type? relative

ask about helper function for follow and what it does again. on paper

help with helper functions
help with listing

Friday's class: getLocal and getChild helper functions? got it

/*void relative(node* n, char* P){
    //cwd + P?
    if(P[0] == '/'){//check if absolute
      P++;//remove first char
      char* tokens;
      char update[];//to be used to modify with
      tokens = strtok(P, "/");
      
      while(tokens != NULL){
        tokens = strtok(NULL, "/");// want all but first token
        strcat(update, tokens);
        strcat(update, "/");//add '/' back
      }
      update[strlen(update)-1] = '\0';//remove trailing '/'
      //what do I do with n?
    }
}

//char* last = strrchr(P, '/');//get '/localname'
//char* localName = last++;// +1 to pointer to skip '/'

/*if(charCompare(left->name, right->name) < 0) return -1;
    else if(charCompare(left->name, right->name) > 0) return 1;
    else return 0;*/
    
    
    
    char* getLocalName(char* P, char* stor){
    //do I need to check if P is ab or rela
    //I assume in this function that P is relative
    char remaining[] = "";
    char* tokens;
    tokens = strtok(P, "/");//CAN'T HAVE SINGLE QUOTES
    stor = tokens;
    
    //go to next localName
    tokens = strtok(NULL, "/");
    
    while(tokens != NULL){
      strcat(remaining, tokens);
      strcat(remaining, "/");//add '/' back
      token = strtok(NULL, "/");
    }
    remaining[strlen(remaining) - 1] = '\0';
    return remaining; //I'm sure remaining is char* type
}


//programmersheaven.com/discussion/212794/find-index-to-the-last-occurrence-of-a-substring-in-c
char* strstrlast(char* path, char* str){
  char* strp;
  int len1, len2;
  len2 = strlen(str);
  if(len2 == 0) 
    return path;
    
  len1 = strlen(path);
  if(len1 - len2 <= 0) 
    return 0;
  
  strp = (char*)(path + len1 - len2);

    if(*strp == *str){
        if(strncmp(strp,str,len2)==0) 
            return strp;
    }
    strp--;
  }
  return 0;  
}


11/3/16: t-cwd should = NULL?
          do I need to check user's path type when passing it into interface functions? YES
          is safeToCreate need other modifications YES
          is insert good?
          Ask about head includes last '/' or doesn't. my method doesn't but notes
          is n->name right in printMatch?
          check mkdir, touch and remove
          look at errors I put in comments
