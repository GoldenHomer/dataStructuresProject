# dataStructuresProject
Final project for my Data Structures class (Fall 2016) while I was pursuing a Master's in Computer Science.
I was to create a primitive Unix file system shell in C, which was not easy but was fun. Codebase has not been modified in any way since I submitted the project to be graded. It's better to witness how I've improved since then.
